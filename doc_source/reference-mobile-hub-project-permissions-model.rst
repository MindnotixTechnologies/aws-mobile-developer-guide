Mobile Hub Project Permissions Model

   * - **Important**

     - **The permissions model for AWS Mobile Hub is changing.**

       This impacts users who have been granted permissions to modify |AMH| projects in an account, but are not an administrator for the account. These users must now be :ref:`granted administrative permissions <reference-mobile-hub-iam-managed-policies-how-to>` to continue to be able to modify the projects in the future. Read this section for more information.

       If you are a user who needs additional permissions for a project, contact an administrator for the AWS account. For help with any issues related to the new permissions model, contact `aws-mobilehub-customer@amazon.com <mailto:aws-mobilehub-customer@amazon.com?subject=Mobile%20Hub%20project%20permissions>`__.

Mobile Hub Permissions - What's Changing?
=========================================

Currently, |AMH| assumes a service role called :code:`MobileHub_Service_Role` in order to modify service configurations on your behalf. This role uses the following managed policy:

`https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSMobileHub_ServiceUseOnly <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSMobileHub_ServiceUseOnly>`__

Mobile Hub's permissions model is changing and will no longer make use of this service role. Instead, |AMH| will use a user's permissions directly when they perform operations in the `Mobile Hub console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/>`__ or :ref:`command line interface <aws-mobile-cli-reference>`. This change provides account administrators more control over what operations their users can perform.

In the old model, all that was required to modify Mobile Hub projects was permissions to call Mobile Hub APIs, typically made console or CLI interactions. An administrator could delegate those permissions by attaching the :code:`AWSMobileHub_FullAccess` policy to an `AWS IAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html>`__ user, group, or role.

With the new model, in addition to permissions to call Mobile Hubâ€™s APIs, users need permissions to perform any of the operations Mobile Hub performs on their behalf. In almost every case, this means an account administrator must :ref:`grant the user the AdministratorAccess policy <reference-mobile-hub-iam-managed-policies-how-to>` in order to access the AWS resources Mobile Hub modifies.

.. _reference-mobile-hub-project-permissions-model-users:

What does this mean to users?
=============================

The impacts of the new permissions model for users include:

#. IAM users, groups and roles that have the :code:`AWSMobileHub_FullAccess` policy will no longer have sufficient permissions to perform any mutating operations in |AMH|, either via the console or :code:`awsmobile` command line interface (CLI).

#. In order for IAM users, groups, or roles to be able to perform mutating operations using Mobile Hub, they must have the appropriate permissions. The only way to ensure an administrator's users have permission to invoke all available operations in Mobile Hub, is to grant them the :code:`AdministratorAccess` policy.

#. If you don't want to grant your users AdministratorAccess individually, then you could create an organization in `AWS Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html>`__, and then create a sub-account for each user or group of users, which you can grant :code:`AdministratorAccess` or other permissions.


.. _reference-mobile-hub-project-permissions-model-why:

Why is the Permissions Model Changing?
======================================

AWS Mobile Hub creates IAM roles and assigns them permissions, in order to enable use of AWS resources in mobile apps. Such operations are considered administrative because they include enabling permission to perform operations on resources in the account. Previously, Mobile Hub's service role provided users who have been granted :code:`AWSMobileHub_FullAccess` permissions with a path to escalate their own privileges to act on resources, potentially in ways their administrator did not intend to permit. Removing the service role, removes the path to escalate privileges and puts control of user permissions directly in the hands of the administrator for a |AMH| project.
